 * server.  The authorization server holds a persistent session on the user's
 * machine through a cookie while the resource server only holds a session cookie.

 * authorization server and then back to this, the resource server, but you will
 * not have to re-login back since your login is controlled through the authorization
 * server's persistent session/cookie.

 * If you're not logged into the authorization server, then you will have to
 * enter your credentials with the authorization server's login form.  Once you're
 * logged in and you're redirected back to the resource server, the access token and
 * refresh token follows with the redirection per the OAuth2 Authorization Code grant.
 * The access token and (optionally) the refresh token are pushed to the client browser
 * to access API calls to protected endpoints.
